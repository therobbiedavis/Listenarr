These copyright headers should be added to the top of source files in the Listenarr project to indicate licensing under AGPL-3.0.

## Notes

- The copyright header should appear at the very top of the file, before any other code.
- For Vue files (.vue), place the header before the `<template>` tag.
- Update the year range as appropriate (e.g., "2024-2026" when contributions are made in 2026).
- These headers satisfy the AGPL-3.0 requirement to display prominent copyright notices.
