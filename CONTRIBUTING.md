# How to Contribute

We're always looking for people to help make Listenarr even better! There are a number of ways to contribute, from documentation to development.

## Documentation

Setup guides, FAQ, troubleshooting tips - the more information we have in the documentation, the better. Help us improve:

- [Wiki](https://github.com/therobbiedavis/Listenarr/wiki) (coming soon)
- Code comments and inline documentation
- README improvements
- Tutorial videos or blog posts

- Canonical contributor guidance and AI-agent rules: see `.github/AGENTS.md`, `.github/CLAUDE.md` and `.github/RULES.md`
## Development

### Tools Required

- **Visual Studio 2022** or higher ([https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/)). The community version is free and works fine.
- **Rider** (optional alternative to Visual Studio, preferred by many) ([https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/))
- **VS Code** (recommended for frontend) ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- **Git** ([https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- **Node.js** (Node 20.x or higher) ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))
- **.NET 8.0 SDK or higher** ([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))

### Getting Started

1. **Fork Listenarr** on GitHub
2. **Clone** the repository to your development machine
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Listenarr.git
   cd Listenarr
   ```
3. **Install root dependencies** (for concurrently)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd fe
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```
5. **Restore .NET dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd listenarr.api
   dotnet restore
   cd ..
   ```
6. **Start development servers**
  Option A - Single command (recommended, runs both API and web):
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  Option B - Start services separately (useful for backend debugging):
  ```bash
  # Terminal 1 - Backend (fast restart on code changes)
  cd listenarr.api
  dotnet watch run

  # Terminal 2 - Frontend
  cd fe
  npm run dev
  ```

7. **Open your browser**
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Debugging

#### Visual Studio / Rider
1. Open `listenarr.sln` in Visual Studio or Rider
2. Set `listenarr.api` as the startup project
3. Press F5 to start debugging
4. The API will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Note: there is also a `watch` task available in the workspace tasks that runs `dotnet watch run` across the solution when you prefer a single task for backend hot-reloads.

#### VS Code
1. Open the root folder in VS Code
2. Use the provided launch configurations in `.vscode/launch.json`
3. Press F5 to start debugging both frontend and backend

#### Debugging on Mobile/Other Devices
- Update the API URL in `fe/src/services/api.ts` to use your development machine's IP address instead of `localhost`
- Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5000` instead of `http://localhost:5000`

### Contributing Code

**Before you start:**
- If you're adding a new feature, please check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/therobbiedavis/Listenarr/issues) to see if it's already requested
- Comment on the issue so work isn't duplicated
- If adding something not already requested, please create an issue first to discuss it
- Reach out on [Discussions](https://github.com/therobbiedavis/Listenarr/discussions) if you have questions

 - Run frontend tests: `cd fe && npm test` (the frontend uses Vitest/Vite; check `fe/package.json` for exact scripts)
- Rebase from Listenarr's `develop` branch, don't merge
- Make meaningful commits, or squash them before submitting PR
- Feel free to make a pull request before work is complete (mark as draft) - this lets us see progress and provide feedback
- Add tests where applicable (unit/integration)
- Commit with *nix line endings for consistency (We checkout Windows and commit *nix)
- One feature/bug fix per pull request to keep things clean and easy to understand

**Code style:**
- **Backend (C#)**: Use 4 spaces instead of tabs (default in VS 2022/Rider)
- **Frontend (Vue/TS)**: Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

#### EF Core & DI guidance (important)
This project follows a layered pattern: domain models in `listenarr.domain`, EF mappings and DbContext in `listenarr.infrastructure`, and services/controllers in `listenarr.api`. Follow these rules when working with EF and DI:

- Where to add EF mappings:
  - Add EF model configuration and ValueConverters in `listenarr.infrastructure`. Keep database-specific concerns (migrations, pragmas, converters) in Infrastructure.
  - Centralized converters are in `listenarr.infrastructure/Persistence/Converters/JsonValueConverters.cs`. Add other shared converters there.

- DbContext registration:
  - Use `AddDbContextFactory<ListenArrDbContext>` for hosted/background services that need DbContext outside of HTTP request scope.
  - Also keep `AddDbContext<ListenArrDbContext>` for compatibility with controllers/endpoints that use scoped DbContext.
  - The helper extension `Listenarr.Api.Extensions.ServiceRegistrationExtensions.AddListenarrPersistence` centralizes these registrations. Call it from `Program.cs` to ensure consistent setup.

- Pattern for hosted services:
  - Inject `IDbContextFactory<ListenArrDbContext>` into hosted/background services and create contexts with `await factory.CreateDbContextAsync(cancellationToken)`.
  - Dispose contexts promptly and avoid storing DbContext as a field.

- Test host behavior:
  - Integration tests use a test partial of Program. To patch the test host, implement `Program.Testing.cs` (or the `ApplyTestHostPatches` hook) to call `AddListenarrPersistence` and any test-specific overrides (e.g. a test SQLite path).
  - Disable or mock heavy external installers (Playwright) in the test host by overriding configuration with an in-memory setting: `builder.Configuration.AddInMemoryCollection(new Dictionary<string,string>{{ "Playwright:Enabled","false"}})`.
  - This prevents CI/tests from spawning external processes while keeping DI consistent.

- New adapters / HttpClients:
  - Register typed or named HttpClients in `listenarr.api` using the `AddListenarrHttpClients` extension or directly in `Program.cs`.
  - Register adapter interfaces in the adapters module (see `listenarr.api/Extensions/ServiceRegistrationExtensions.cs`).
  - If a factory delegate is required (resolve adapter by id), register a `Func<string, IDownloadClientAdapter>` as a singleton that resolves registered adapters.

- Testing tips:
  - Add unit tests for ValueConverters and ValueComparers to ensure JSON behavior is stable (null handling, empty JSON).
  - Use `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` for integration tests and apply `WithWebHostBuilder` when you need to override services.
  - Use the test-host patching approach to keep tests hermetic (no external network or process calls).

**Testing:**
- Run backend tests: `cd listenarr.api && dotnet test`
- Run frontend tests: `cd fe && npm run test:unit`
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

### Pull Request Guidelines

**Branch naming:**
- Create PRs from feature branches, not from `develop` in your fork
- Use meaningful branch names that describe what is being added/fixed

Good examples:
- `feature/audible-integration`
- `feature/download-queue`
- `bugfix/search-results`
- `enhancement/ui-improvements`

Bad examples:
- `new-feature`
- `fix-bug`
- `patch`
- `develop`

**PR process:**
1. **Target branch**: Only make pull requests to `canary`, never `main` or `develop`
   - PRs to `main` and `develop` will be commented on and closed
2. **Description**: Provide a clear description of what your PR does
   - Reference related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - List breaking changes if any
3. **Review**: You'll probably get comments or questions from us
   - These are to ensure consistency and maintainability
   - Don't take them personally - we appreciate your contribution!
4. **Response time**: We'll try to respond as soon as possible
   - If it's been a few days without response, please ping us
   - We may have missed the notification

**PR checklist:**
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review of code completed
- [ ] Comments added for complex logic
- [ ] Tests added/updated (if applicable)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Rebased on latest `canary` branch

## Layering rules & migration steps (practical)
- Keep contracts (interfaces, DTOs, domain models) in `listenarr.application` or `listenarr.domain`.
- Keep framework-dependent implementations (EF Core, HttpClients, filesystem) in `listenarr.infrastructure`.
- `listenarr.api` should only compose services, host controllers, and register DI; do not add new interfaces that duplicate application/infrastructure contracts.
- Migration checklist for misplaced interface + implementation found in `listenarr.api`:
  1. Move the interface/DTO to `listenarr.application` or `listenarr.domain`.
  2. Move the concrete implementation to `listenarr.infrastructure/Services`.
  3. Add registration in `listenarr.infrastructure/Extensions/InfrastructureServiceRegistrationExtensions.cs` (e.g., `services.AddScoped<IFoo, Foo>();`).
  4. In `listenarr.api/Program.cs` call the infrastructure registration extension instead of registering types inline.
  5. Delete the old API placeholder files and run `dotnet test` to verify no regressions.
- Add a small DI/registration unit test (DependencyInjectionTests) that asserts required services are resolvable; run it early in CI to catch layering regressions.
