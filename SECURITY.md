## Security Best Practices

### Deployment Security

1. **Authentication**
   - Enable authentication in production environments
   - Use strong passwords for admin accounts
   - Change default credentials immediately after setup

2. **Network Security**
   - Deploy behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik, Caddy)
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for all external connections
   - Restrict access using firewall rules or VPN

3. **API Keys & Credentials**
   - Store download client credentials securely
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Never commit secrets to version control

4. **File System Access**
   - Run with minimal required permissions
   - Use read-only mounts where possible
   - Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal

5. **Docker Security**
   - Use non-root user in containers
   - Keep base images updated
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities regularly

### Configuration Security

1. **Database**
   - SQLite database stored in `/config/database/` (Docker) or `listenarr.api/config/database/`
   - Ensure proper file permissions on database files
   - Regular backups recommended

2. **Image Cache**
   - Cached images stored in `/config/cache/images/`
   - Automatically cleaned up by background service
   - No user data stored in cache

3. **Logs**
   - Logs may contain sensitive information
   - Stored in `/config/logs/` directory
   - Implement log rotation to prevent disk space issues
   - Review log access permissions

### Known Security Considerations

1. **Download Client Integration**
   - Listenarr connects to external download clients (qBittorrent, Transmission, SABnzbd, NZBGet)
   - Ensure download clients are secured and not publicly exposed
   - Use HTTPS when possible for download client connections

2. **Metadata APIs**
   - Audible/Audnexus API used for metadata enrichment
   - Amazon URLs processed for ASIN extraction
   - No user credentials sent to external services

3. **Search Providers**
   - Multiple torrent/NZB APIs supported
   - API keys for indexers stored in configuration
   - Ensure indexer API keys are kept confidential

4. **WebHooks/Notifications**
   - Discord webhooks supported for notifications
   - Webhook URLs may contain sensitive tokens
   - Configure webhook URLs carefully to prevent leaks

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 0.2.19 → 0.2.20) and documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
